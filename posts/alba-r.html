                <h2>ALBA-R (Adaptive Load-Balancing Rainbow)</h2>
                <p>
                ALBA-R is a cross layer geographic protocol for convergecasting in WSNs. It features the
integration of awake/asleep schedules, MAC, routing, load balancing, and back-to-back
packet transmissions (ALBA) with a mechanism for recognizing and routing around
connectivity holes (Rainbow).
                </p>
                <h3>ALBA</h3>
                <p>
                The basic operations of ALBA are as follows. Nodes in the network alternate between
awake/asleep modes according to independent wake-up schedules with fixed duty cycle.
When a node x has packets to forward, it polls its neighbors by broadcasting a
Request-to-Send (RTS) packet. Neighboring nodes that are currently awake respond with a
Clear-to-Send (CTS) packet carrying information based on which x can choose the best
relay. More specifically, for each neighbor y that has sent a CTS packet, node x computes
the following two parameters: The queue priority index of y (QPI<sub>y</sub>), and the geographic
priority index of y (GPI<sub>y</sub>). The parameter QPI<sub>y</sub> quantifies how fast and well node y can
move packets forward, taking into account its recent past performance as a relay. It is
defined as the
min { &lceil;(Q<sub>y</sub> + N<sub>B</sub>)/M<sub>y</sub>&rceil;, N<sub>B</sub>, max }, where Q<sub>y</sub> indicates the number of packets in the queue of
node y, N<sub>B</sub> is the number of packets that node x wants to transmit in a burst (back-to-back
transmissions, up to N<sub>Bmax</sub> packets), and M<sub>y</sub> indicates the number of packets that node y
was able to transmit back-to-back, without errors, in the recent past (it is a moving weighted
average of recent transmission attempts). The QPI has been designed so that if node y is
congested (i.e., has a high queue occupancy Q<sub>y</sub>) or it has been a “bad forwarder”
(experiencing high packet transmission errors, i.e., it has a low M<sub>y</sub>) it is less frequently
chosen as a relay. The parameter GPI<sub>y</sub> indicates the geographic advancement towards the
sink that node y can provide. It is computed based on the locations of node x, node y and of
the sink. The GPI is used to discriminate among relays that have the same forwarding
performance, i.e., the same QPI. Nodes with higher GPI are preferred.
                </p>
                <h3>Rainbow</h3>
                <p>
                GPI-based forwarding implements the typical greedy approach to geographical routing that
works well whenever relays towards the sink can be found, e.g., in dense networks. In
sparser WSNs, or in networks deployed around obstacles, greedily choosing the next hop
relay is not always possible due to the presence of a dead end, which hinders routing
performance severely. Rainbow extends ALBA to provide a mechanism for detecting and
routing around connectivity holes whenever they occur in WSNs. The basic idea is allowing
the nodes to forward packets away from the sink when a relay in the direction of the sink
cannot be found. In order to remember whether to seek for relays in the direction of the sink
(positive advancement area F) or in the opposite direction (negative advancement area F<sup>C</sup>)
each node is labeled by a color (from a given list) and seeks for relays among neighbors with
its own color or with the color immediately before in the list. Hop by hop forwarding follows
the rules established by ALBA. As an example, assume the following list of possible colors:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>yellow;</li>
                    <li>red;</li>
                    <li>blue;</li>
                    <li>purple.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                Initially, all nodes are colored yellow, and function according to the basic ALBA rules, i.e.,
they look for relays located in the region F that provide positive advancement towards the
sink. If no connectivity holes are encountered, all nodes remain yellow, keeping finding
relays in the direction of the sink. Nodes that cannot find relays offering positive
advancement infer that they may actually be dead ends, and change their color to red.
According to Rainbow, red nodes will send the packet away from the sink by searching for
yellow or red nodes in their region F<sup>C</sup>. If a red node cannot find red or yellow nodes in F<sup>C</sup>, it
changes its color again, becoming a blue node. It will now look only for blue or red relays in
F. Similarly, a blue node that cannot find blue or red relays in F turns purple, and starts
looking for purple or blue nodes in F<sup>C</sup>. This process continues until all nodes have
converged to their final color.
                </p>
                <h3>Conclusions</h3>
                <p>
                ALBA-R outperforms all previous solutions. The scheme designed to handle dead ends,
Rainbow, is fully distributed, has low overhead, and makes it possible to route packets
around connectivity holes without resorting to the creation and maintenance of planar
topology graphs. Rainbow is shown to guarantee packet delivery under arbitrary localization
errors, at the sole cost of a limited increase in route length.
