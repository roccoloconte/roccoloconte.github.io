                <p>
                Synchronized protocols, such as S-MAC and T-MAC, negotiate a schedule that specifies
when nodes are awake and asleep within a frame. Specifying the time when nodes must be
awake in order to communicate reduces the time and energy wasted in idle listening.
Asynchronous protocols such as B-MAC, and WiseMAC, rely on low power listening (LPL),
also called preamble sampling, to link together a sender with data to a receiver who is duty
cycling. Idle listening is reduced in asynchronous protocols by shifting the burden of
synchronization to the sender. When a sender has data, the sender transmits a preamble
that is at least as long as the sleep period of the receiver. The receiver will wake up, detect
the preamble, and stay awake to receive the data. This allows low power communication
without the need for explicit synchronization between the nodes. The receiver only wakes for
a short time to sample the medium, thereby limiting idle listening. A key advantage of
asynchronous low power listening protocols is that the sender and receiver can be
completely decoupled in their duty cycles. The simplicity of this design removes the need for,
and the overhead introduced by, synchronized wake/sleep schedules.
                </p>
                <p>
                While the low power listening approach is simple, asynchronous, and energy-efficient, the
long preamble in low power listening exhibits several disadvantages: it is suboptimal in terms
of energy consumption at both the sender and receiver, it is subject to overhearing that
causes excess energy consumption at non-target receivers, and it introduces excess latency
at each hop. First, the receiver typically has to wait the full period until the preamble is
finished before the data/ack exchange can begin, even if the receiver has woken up at the
start of the preamble. This wastes energy at both the receiver and transmitter. Second, the
low power listening approach suffers from the overhearing problem, where receivers who are
not the target of the sender also wake up during the long preamble and have to stay awake
until the end of the preamble to find out if the packet is destined for them. This wastes
energy at all non-target receivers within transmission range of the sender. Third, because
the target receiver has to wait for the full preamble before receiving the data packet, the
per-hop latency is lower bounded by the preamble length. Over a multi-hop path, this latency
can accumulate to become quite substantial.
                </p>
                <h3>Short Preamble</h3>
                <p>
                X-MAC employs a short preamble to further reduce energy consumption and to reduce
latency. The first idea is to embed address information of the target in the preamble so that
non-target receivers can quickly go back to sleep. This addresses the overhearing problem.
                </p>
                <h3>Strobed Preamble</h3>
                <p>
                The second idea is to use a strobed preamble to allow the target receiver to interrupt the
long preamble as soon as it wakes up and determines that it is the target receiver. Inserting
pauses into the series of short preamble packets, creating a strobed preamble, enables the
target receiver to shorten the strobed preamble via an early acknowledgment. This short
strobed preamble approach reduces the time and energy wasted waiting for the entire
preamble to complete.
                </p>
                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>
                X-MAC results in significant savings in terms of both energy and per-hop latency. It can also
use an adaptive algorithm to dynamically adjust receiver duty cycles to optimize for energy
consumption per packet, latency, or both. Thus, the only limit in this protocol is that it still
needs to send preambles before the node wakes up.
