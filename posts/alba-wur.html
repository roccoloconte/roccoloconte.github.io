                <p>
                The use of the WRx produces remarkable energy savings, and achieves lifetimes that are
decades longer than those obtained by ALBA-R in sensing systems with duty cycling, while
keeping latencies at bay.
                </p>
                <p>
                ALBA-R is redesigned to work with the wake-up features of the WRx. When a node x has
packets to transmit, it wakes up only those neighbors that satisfy the following conditions. To
start with, only nodes with the appropriate color will be woken up. For instance, if x is blue,
the wake-up address should be chosen so that only nodes that are either blue or red will
wake-up. Within this set of nodes, node x will want to wake-up those nodes y that can
receive the number of packets N<sub>B</sub> that x needs to transmit, and with their M<sub>y</sub> above a given
threshold. To do so, x broadcasts a wake-up packet made up of the following fields:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>its color;</li>
                    <li>the number of packets N<sub>B</sub>;</li>
                    <li>the target QPI it is currently looking for.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                Nodes that can serve as relays indicate their availability by assigning to themselves a pool of
WRx addresses, dynamically updated based on their status, each of which expresses a
combination of the three values:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>sender color;</li>
                    <li>burst size;</li>
                    <li>target QPI the node can satisfy.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                For example, according to Rainbow, a node whose color is blue can only serve as a relay for
nodes with color blue or red. Thus, the pool of its WRx addresses will contain only
sequences with either Color = blue or Color = red (see example below). The last two fields of
the WRx address are set based on the queue occupancy status of the node and on its
forwarding history. In particular, for each possible burst size that the node can accept based
on its queue status, it computes the corresponding QPI value and stores it in the last field of
the address. When a wake-up packet is received, addresses in the pool are checked for a
match. If the packet matches one of the addresses, the node wakes up. The addressing
mechanism of ALBA-WUR is illustrated by the following example. Let us consider a red node
y that currently has one packet stored in its queue, i.e., Q<sub>y</sub> = 1, and such that its moving
weighted average of recent transmission attempts is 2, i.e., M<sub>y</sub> = 2. If the maximum number
of packets that can be sent in a burst is N<sub>Bmax</sub> = 2, to serve as relay node y will have the
following four wake-up addresses in its pool, each corresponding to a combination of color
(red or blue), burst size and the target QPI it can satisfy.

                <table style="width:80%;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center;">
                  <tbody><tr><td>Color = red</td><td>Burst size = 1</td><td>QPI = 1</td></tr>
                  <tr><td>Color = red</td><td>Burst size = 2</td><td>QPI = 2</td></tr>
                  <tr><td>Color = blue</td><td>Burst size = 1</td><td>QPI = 1</td></tr>
                  <tr><td>Color = blue</td><td>Burst size = 2</td><td>QPI = 2</td></tr>
                </tbody></table>
                <p>
                A node x whose color is blue, with N<sub>B</sub> = 1 data packets to transmit and looking for a relay
with the best possible QPI will broadcast the following wake-up packet.
                </p>
                <p style="text-align:center;">
                Color = blue &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Burst size = 1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Target QPI = 1
                </p>
                <p>
                The neighbors of node x that receive this packet will wake up their main microcontroller and
radio only if the wake-up packet matches one of the addresses in their pool. For instance,
node y would wake up, as the third address in its pool matches the wake-up packet sent by
x. After the selective awakening phase, node x waits for neighboring nodes to turn their radio
on, and sends an RTS packet using the main radio. The nexthop relay is then chosen
according to ALBA-R operations. If no neighbor is found that can satisfy the requests of
node x, the awakening process is repeated with x now lowering its demands, i.e., seeking for
nodes with different status (e.g., a lower QPI and/or burst size). It is worth noting how the
complex relay selection policies that make ALBA-R one of the high-performance protocols
for WSN routing are naturally expressed by the dynamic semantic addressing of
ALBA-WUR, as simply implemented via our WRx technology. Protocol design is no longer
driven by the need of trading off energy consumption and lifetime for latency, as efficiently
implemented semantic addressing enables senders to quickly select only those among their
neighbors that can best further the routing process. For instance, in noisy environments in
which the WRx is subject to interferences that can result in false negatives, an error-tolerant
or partial address matching mechanism can be employed.
